# <p align="middle">Collection of my projects at Hive Helsinki</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The projects in `C` are made in accordance with a programming standard called `Norm` that defines a strict set of rules to follow when writing code. The full standard can be viewed [here](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).

## [push_swap](https://github.com/mordori/push-swap)

Simple wireframe model software renderer with limited file parsing.
- Implements a software-based geometry pipeline similar to that of modern GPUs
- Uses the Liang-Barsky algorithm for line clipping and Bresenham’s algorithm for rasterizing the lines
- Follows an OpenGL-style right-handed coordinate convention, where Y is up, X is to the right, and in view space the camera looks down -Z
- Includes an orbiting camera controller that emulates the navigation style of 3D modeling software like Blender

## born2beroot

Project about creating a virtual machine in VirtualBox, installing Debian, and implementing strict rules for use.
- Topics explored included LVM, SSH, ufw, sudo, users, passwords, logs, and cron among other things
- Clear understanding of the commands and protocols used was a rigorous instruction for this project

## [get_next_line](https://github.com/mordori/get_next_line)

Function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
- Included in `libft`

## [ft_printf](https://github.com/mordori/ft_printf)

Simplified recreation of the variadic `printf` function.
- Included in `libft`

## [libft](https://github.com/mordori/libft)

Library of commonly used standard and additional utility functions from libc recreated in C.
- Some of the functions have been modified from the subject, e.g. to handle errors
- Includes functions from subsequently completed projects and expanded utility implementations
